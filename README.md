# professional-statement outline
To develop a professional statement that briefly explains who you are and what you are
passionate about, follow the steps outlined.
# Step one
**List two to three strengths that you currently have or are committed to developing** (e.g.,
strong written and verbal communication, time management, programming, etc.).

Having an inventory of your strengths can help you create your professional statement. It may
also encourage you to focus on skills you want to develop

# Step two
**List one to two values you have** have (e.g., protecting organizations, protecting people, adhering
to laws, ensuring equitable access, etc.).

Establishing your values can help you and a prospective employer determine if your goals are
aligned. Ensure that you are representing yourself accurately, and be honest about what
motivates you.

# Step three
Ask yourself some **clarifying questions** to determine what to include in your professional statement:
1. What most interests me about the field of cybersecurity?
2. Who is the audience for my professional statement (e.g., cybersecurity recruiters,
specific organizations, government employers, etc.)?
3. In what ways can my strengths, values, and interest in cybersecurity support the
security goals of various organizations?
